# Vanilla Theme Boilerplate


## Description

A responsive, theme boilerplate for Vanilla in SCSS.


## Notes

- This theme contains javascript to animate the open and close of the mobile navigation menu.
- This theme sets its own flyout open/close listeners.

## Instalation

Refer to the [installation guide](https://github.com/vanilla/themes/blob/master/vanilla-theme-boilerplate/guide.md). 


## Building Styles / Javascript / Images

This theme is built with the [Vanilla Cli](https://docs.vanillaforums.com/developer/vanilla-cli/) and does not come with its own build toolchain. With that installed you can simply run:
```bash
vanilla build
```
or
```bash
vanilla build --watch
```
to build your styles/js/images. Documentation for the CLI can be found [here](https://docs.vanillaforums.com/developer/vanilla-cli/#build-tools).
